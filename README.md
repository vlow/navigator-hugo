# Navigator Hugo (lokaler.kaufen)
This is a fork of themefisher's navigator-hugo theme. It is tailored to fit the needs of [https://lokaler.kaufen](https://lokaler.kaufen), a non-profit project which aims to help small shops troubled by the current COVID-19 outbreak.

## Changes
Most of the original documentation holds still true for this fork, but we made some minor changes:

* We adjusted the color scheme to our color palette
* We added a signup-banner to collect the e-mail addresses of interested users right on top of the page
* We did a little cleanup of the default single page, since we don't intend to use the page as a blog atm
* We removed of the large contact form and the Google Maps integration on the bottom of the page
* We replaced the newsletter signup box with a customizable logo, so we can put the [#WirVsVirusHackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) logo in the footer
* Some minor changes along the way

We also removed the example page since it is designed very specifically to our [website](https://lokaler.kaufen), which is the best example there is.

## Integration
In order to integrate this template into a Hugo site, just clone it as a submodule into the themes folder as described in the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
